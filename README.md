# Brainfuck Challenges Repository

Welcome to the Brainfuck Challenges repository! This collection of challenges is designed to test your skills in the esoteric programming language, Brainfuck. Feel free to explore, solve, and optimize the provided challenges. If you're new to Brainfuck, it's a minimalistic programming language known for its challenging syntax.

## Language Overview

Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. There is a pointer, initially pointing to the first memory cell. The commands include:

- `>` Move the pointer to the right
- `<` Move the pointer to the left
- `+` Increment the memory cell at the pointer
- `-` Decrement the memory cell at the pointer
- `.` Output the character signified by the cell at the pointer
- `,` Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer
- `[` Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0
- `]` Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero

All characters other than `><+-.,[]` should be considered comments and ignored.

### History

Brainfuck was invented by Urban Müller in 1993 as an attempt to create the smallest possible compiler for the Amiga OS, version 2.0. Müller succeeded in developing a 240-byte compiler. The language was inspired by FALSE, which had a 1024-byte compiler. The lowercase naming convention ("brainfuck") was chosen by Müller.

It is not known to what extent Müller was aware of or influenced by Böhm's language P′′ published in 1964, of which brainfuck can be considered a minor variation.
